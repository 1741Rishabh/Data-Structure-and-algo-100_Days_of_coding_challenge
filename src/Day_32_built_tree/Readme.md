# Day 32   Tree Traversal

# What is Tree Traversal
Tree traversal means visiting each node of the tree. The tree is a non-linear data structure, and therefore its traversal is different from other linear data structures. There is only one way to visit each node/element in linear data structures, i.e. starting from the first value and traversing in a linear order.

# Types of Tree Traversal:
1. Preorder traversal

2. Inorder traversal

3. Postorder traversal

## Example 1:

````
INPUT
int arr[] = {29,28,27,-1,-1,26,-1,-1,25,-1,24,-1,-1};

Output
postorder
27  26  28  24  25  29  
inorder
27 28 26 29 25 24 
preorder
29 28 27 26 25 24
