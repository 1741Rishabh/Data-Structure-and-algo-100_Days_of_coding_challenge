# Day 17 Question
Kth smallest element


## Question Description
Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

# Sample Input :
- N = 6
- arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
- K = 3
# Sample Output: 
- 7

# Explanation:
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.

# Expected Time Complexity: 
`O(n)`
# Expected Auxiliary Space: 
`O(log(n))`
# Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 105`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= K <= N`
